However, as years passed, I realized that my true passion lies in the field of Programming and Computer Science. At the moment, I am a student at the Open Greek University, specializing in Computer Science.</p><p> My passion is to write applications using different programming languages that I've learned through the university and self-studying. I have experience in C, Python, HTML, CSS, JS languages, and Django Framework (for web applications). Also, I am working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite), i am familiar with CRUD operations and I know Git and Github. My coursework at the Open Greek University has provided me with more knowledge on Programming, Mathematics, and Software Technology.</p><p>I actively engage in personal projects related to full-stack development, currently developing 3 apps. Overall, my goal is on the one side to work as a Full Stack Developer and on the other to collaborate with a team to develop AI and cyber security apps. I believe in the power of combining different technologies to create innovations.</p><p> If you're interested in discussing potential opportunities or have any questions, reach out to me.</p><p>You can message me at dimitris_stefanakis12@yahoo.com or call me at 6945579411. <br>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p></section></main><footer>    <p>&copy; 2023 My Portfolio.
