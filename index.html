However, I realized that my true passion lies in the field of Programming and Computer Science. Consequently, I dedicated my fifth year of Agricultural University of Athens to self-studying programming, focusing on the C language through a big and comprehensive YouTube course (around 300 videos). This experience allowed me to develop problem-solving skills and write complete semi-advanced applications using C.</p><p>Continuing my pursuit of knowledge, I am currently a student at the Open Greek University, specializing in Computer Science. I have successfully completed three full yearly courses, and I'm currently in my third year of studies. My coursework at the Open Greek University has provided me with more knowledge on Programming, Mathematics and Software Technology.</p><p>Along with my studies i self-studied HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. I actively engage in personal projects related to front-end development, working on honing my skills. Overall, my goal is on the one side to become a Full Stack Developer and on the other to collaborate with a team to develop AI applications and games. I believe in the power of combining different technologies to create innovative and impactful solutions.</p><p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also participated in various seminars and webinars to expand my knowledge and gain practical experience. I attended a seminar on Python at MIT, a Web Development webinar, and a Video Editing seminar at AKTO. These experiences have broadened my skill set and allowed me to explore different aspects of technology.</p><p>While I haven't had the opportunity to work in my specific field of interest yet, I have been working as a part-time Delivery and Service to support myself financially. This experience has taught me valuable lessons in responsibility, time management, and adaptability.</p><p>I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and passion to the world of technology and collaborating with like-minded professionals. If you're interested in discussing potential opportunities or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach me out.</p><p>You can reach me at dimitris_stefanakis12@yahoo.com or call me at 6945579411.<br>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p></section></main><footer>    <p>&copy; 2023 My Portfolio.
